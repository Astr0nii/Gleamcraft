Gleamcraft adds a beautiful new material to Minecraft - Glimmerstone. These rare, luminescent crystals can be crafted into tools and weapons that emit light when held, providing both practical functionality and aesthetic appeal to your Minecraft experience.


Wiki coming soon, all stats subject to balancing changes! More game versions will be released upon request!

### Finding Glimmerstone

Glimmerstone ore spawns in small veins below Y-level 32, making it a rare find during your mining expeditions. The ore emits a faint glow, making it easier to spot in dark caves.

Glimmerstone ore has the following generation properties:
- Spawn rate: Similar to diamond ore but slightly more common
- Vein size: 1-8 blocks
- Y-level: Below 32, with higher concentration between Y-levels 5-15

## Materials and Crafting

### Glimmerstone Crystals

Mining Glimmerstone ore with any pickaxe (iron or better needed) will drop Glimmerstone crystals. These crystals are the base material for crafting all Gleamcraft items.

#### Tools and Weapons

## Features

### Light Emission

All Glimmerstone tools and weapons emit light when held in either your main hand or off-hand. This creates a moving light source around the player, making exploration of dark caves and nighttime adventures much easier.

### Sunlight Recharging

Glimmerstone tools slowly recharge when exposed to sunlight. The recharging mechanism works as follows:

1. Tools gradually lose durability through normal use
2. When in direct sunlight (no weather), tools will slowly regain durability
3. A fully depleted tool will require approximately five full Minecraft days to fully recharge

### Tool Stats

Glimmerstone tools have stats that position them between iron and diamond:

| Tool Type | Attack Speed | Durability | Damage |

| Shovel    | 1            | 750        | 4.75   |
